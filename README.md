## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transfer-learning-tensorflow.git
    cd transfer-learning-tensorflow
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the necessary datasets:
    - Follow the instructions in `data/data_loader.py` to download and prepare the datasets.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**:
    - Ensure your dataset is downloaded and prepared as described in `data/data_loader.py`.

2. **Model Setup and Training**:
    - Run the training script:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

## File Details

- **data/data_loader.py**: Script for downloading and loading datasets.
- **models/model_setup.py**: Script for defining and setting up the model.
- **scripts/utils.py**: Utility functions used across the project.
- **main.py**: Main script that integrates all components and runs the transfer learning process.
- **notebooks/original_notebook.ipynb**: Original Colab notebook for reference.
